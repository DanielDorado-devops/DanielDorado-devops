## About Me

I am a **DevOps Engineer** with a focus on **CI/CD and Cloud Architecture**.
I develop robust, scalable solutions for SaaS platforms in cloud environments (primarily AWS). 
My goal is to optimize the deployment pipeline, enhance operational efficiency, and leverage cloud-based **Machine Learning (ML)** technologies, particularly within MLOps.

My technical expertise includes working with tools like **Jenkins**, **Terraform**, **Kubernetes (EKS)**, **ArgoCD**, and **AWS** to automate and streamline deployments. I have a solid background in **monitoring** and **logging** to ensure system resilience, along with experience in **gaming infrastructures** and **multi-cloud workflows**.

I also enjoy exploring AI-driven products, integrating solutions like **Spacy**, **NLTK**, **TensorFlow**, and **Flask** for data-driven applications and automation.
